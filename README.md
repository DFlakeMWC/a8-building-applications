##### 1. Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who.

> I performed some troubleshooting/debugging with a classmate, Nick Haener

##### 2. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?

> 8 - 10 hours

##### 3. On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this challenge?

> 7.5

##### 4. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?

> The major problem I faced with this challenge was trying to figure out how to pass in an input for sepal/petal on top of the input for species for the plot. It was fairly simple getting the plot to render for one input but the variable input for the petal/sepal length and width was the reason for hours of debugging.
